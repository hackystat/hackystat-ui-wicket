  <span wicket:id="PageContents">This page will provide a variety of perspectives on your sensor data.</span>
<p>I am envisioning at least the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Select a project (including Default), and a day, and it will use the Project Summary to display a table of all the kinds of sensor data that were collected on this day.  The table will include a "view" column so that you can see, for any given type of data (or the entire lot), the actual sensor data instances.</li>
  <li> Some kind of comparison mode so you can see how today's data counts compare to yesterday, last week, etc.</li>
</ul>
