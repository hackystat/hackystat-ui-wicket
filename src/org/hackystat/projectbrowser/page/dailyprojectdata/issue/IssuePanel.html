<p>
The goal of this analysis is to provide a perspective on the developer's impact on the 
system under issue tracking system. Each row shows, for a given project, the  
number of different status of issues, as well as the total count of open and closed issues.
</p>

<p>
In a healthy project, developers should regulary create issues, work on them and then close them. 
So the number of open issues should be relatively stable while closed issues increase over time.
