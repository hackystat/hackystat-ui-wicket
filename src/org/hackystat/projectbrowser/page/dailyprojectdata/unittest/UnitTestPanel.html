<p>
The goal of this analysis is to provide a perspective on the amount of test invocations associated
with a set of projects.  Each row of the table provides a perspective on test 
invocations for a single
project.  The perspective indicates how many unit test invocations passed and how many unit test
invocations failed, 
as well as how many total unit test invocations occurred.  
Note that if a given test will be counted multiple times, once for each time it was invoked. 
</p>

<p>
This analysis provides a sense for testing "activity" associated with a given project.  Projects
that depart significantly from their "baseline" level of testing activities might be
encountering new development conditions that might impact on schedule or resources.  
</p>

<p>
To facilitate comparison between projects, you can specify either "Count" or "Percentage" when 
generating this table.  "Count" shows the absolute number of unit test invocations.
"Percentage" shows the proportion of invocations that passed or failed.
Using "Count" helps you distinguish between projects that have very different numbers
of invocations, while 
using "Percentage" enables you to more easily compare projects with a "normalized" value.
