The goal of this analysis is to provide a perspective on the amount of developer "DevTime" 
associated with one or more projects.  Each row shows, for a given project, the total 
DevTime along with the breakdown of DevTime per developer for that day. 
</p>

<p>
DevTime is an imperfect proxy for developer "effort".  It works in the following way. For 
tools such as IDEs like Eclipse, developer activities within the tool generates "DevEvent" 
instances, which basically indicate that at the given timestamp, the developer was interacting
with the tool.  A tool such as Eclipse can generates dozens of DevEvent instances per hour
under typical usage.      
</p>

<p>
The DevTime metric is computed from the raw DevEvent sensor data in the following way.  Each day
is divided into 288 five minute intervals (from 12:00 midnight to 12:04:59.999am, 
12:05am to 12:09:59.999am, etc.)   If there is at least one DevEvent within a given five minute
interval, then the developer gets DevTime for all five minutes within that interval.  Thus, 
DevTime is always a multiple of 5.   
</p>

<p>
DevTime is an imperfect measure of developer effort because it does not take into account 
developer activities done away from instrumented tools.  For example, time in meetings, 
time spent on the phone, or time thinking about the project in the shower does not count
as DevTime.
