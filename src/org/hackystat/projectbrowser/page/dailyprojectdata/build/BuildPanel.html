The goal of this analysis is to provide a perspective on the amount of build invocations associated
with a set of projects.  Each row of the table provides a perspective on build 
invocations for a single
project.  The perspective indicates how many build invocations passed and how many
 failed, 
as well as how many total builds occurred.  

</p>

    <p>
This analysis provides a sense for build "activity" associated with a given project.  Projects
that depart significantly from their "baseline" level of build counts or success/failure
ratio  might be
encountering new development conditions that might impact on schedule or resources.  
</p>

    <p>
To facilitate comparison between projects, you can specify either "Count" or "Percentage" when 
generating this table.  "Count" shows the absolute number of build invocations.
"Percentage" shows the proportion of invocations that passed or failed.
Using "Count" helps you distinguish between projects that have very different numbers
of invocations, while 
using "Percentage" enables you to more easily compare projects with a "normalized" value.
