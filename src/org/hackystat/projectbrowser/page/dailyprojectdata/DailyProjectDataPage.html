  <p>When completed, this page should contain a set of controls that allow a user to select a date, a project, and a kind of daily analysis to display.  The resulting display could provide things like the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li> A 'snapshot' of the project with respect to that daily analysis on that day.</li>
  <li> A comparison of that data to the state of the project yesterday, last week, or last month.</li>
  <li> A 'table' and 'graph' checkbox, which enables the user to see the data in tabular or graphical form (using, for example google charts.)</li>
</ul>
