<p>
The goal of this analysis is to provide a perspective on the developer's impact on the 
system under configuration management. Each row shows, for a given project, the total  
number of commits made by the developer for the specified day, as well as the total churn
(the number of lines added, lines deleted, and lines modified as a result of these
commits). 
</p>

<p>
In a healthy project, developers should have a relatively stable number of commits and 
a relatively stable level of churn, although both upward and downward spikes in commits 
and churn can be present in a healthy project.
