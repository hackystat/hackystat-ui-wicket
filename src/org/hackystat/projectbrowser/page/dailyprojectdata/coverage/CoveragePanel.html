<p>
The goal of this analysis is to provide a perspective on the quality of testing associated
with a set of projects.  Each row of the table provides a perspective on coverage for a single
project.  The perspective indicates how many classes fall into each of five possible
ranges for coverage: 0-20%, 20-40%, 40-60%, 60-80%, and 80-100%.  Ideally, 
100% of the classes will have 100% coverage, which would result in all of the classes appearing
in the 80-100% range.
</p>

<p>
To facilitate comparison between projects, you can specify either "Count" or "Percentage" when 
generating this table.  "Count" shows the absolute number of classes whose coverage falls within
the given range.  "Percentage" shows the proportion of classes for this project that falls within
the given range.  Using "Count" helps you distinguish between large and small projects, while 
using "Percentage" enables you to more easily compare projects with a "normalized" value.

Different coverage tools support different types. For example, Emma supports "Method", "Block", 
"Line", and "Class".  Clover supports "Conditional", "Element", "Statement", and "Method".
