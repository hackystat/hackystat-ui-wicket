<p>
The goal of this analysis is to provide a perspective on the quality of testing associated
with a set of projects.  Each row of the table provides a perspective on coverage for a single
project.  The coverage perspective indicates how many classes fall into each of five possible
ranges for coverage: 0-20%, 20-40%, 40-60%, 60-80%, and 80-100%.  Ideally, 
100% of the classes will have 100% coverage, which would result in all of the classes appearing
in the 80-100% range.
</p>

<p>
To facilitate comparison between projects, the table indicates the absolute number of classes falling into a
given range as well as the percentage of the total number of classes.  This allows you to distinguish
between big vs. small projects as well as compare with a "normalized" value.
