<p>
The goal of this analysis is to provide a perspective on the design quality of one or more 
projects through the level of coupling associated with each class.  
</p>
<p>
"Afferent" coupling 
indicates the "responsibility" associated with a class, in other words, how many other classes
use it.  If a class has high afferent coupling, then changes to this class are likely to have
a ripple effect on other classes.  "Efferent" coupling represents the independence of a class,
or the number of other classes it must use in order to accomplish its task.
If a class has high efferent coupling, then it could be negatively impacted by changes to many 
other parts of the system.
</p>
<p>

Each row of the table provides a perspective on coupling for a single
project.  The perspective indicates how many classes fall into each of five possible
ranges for coupling: 0-5, 6-10, 11-15, 15-20, and 20+.  
</p>

<p>
To facilitate comparison between projects, you can specify either "Count" or "Percentage" when 
generating this table.  "Count" shows the absolute number of classes whose coupling falls within
the given range.  "Percentage" shows the proportion of classes for this project that falls within
the given range.  Using "Count" helps you distinguish between large and small projects, while 
using "Percentage" enables you to more easily compare projects with a "normalized" value.

<p>
Currently, this analysis focusses on "class" coupling as produced by the DependencyFinder tool.
