	<b>About this page:</b> 
    This page provides a way to visualize telemetry trends for different projects and different date 
    ranges for each project. By selecting two projects, a chart and date ranges for each project, 
    you will generate two telemetry time series which can be viewed simultaneously. In addition to 
    that, Trajectory provides an implementation of Dynamic Time Warping algorithm which finds the 
    optimal mapping between two time series. Our DTW implementation normalizes time series before 
    analysis and allows customization through local and global constraints, distance definitions and
    open-end alignment.
